#  Build a Multi Line Chart | #B2VB 2025 | Week 2

## Goal
Multiple line charts are great for comparing trends across time periods, such as months or years. However, too many lines can result in a cluttered-looking "spaghetti chart," making insights harder to interpret.

This week, we’d like you to create a Multiple Line Chart using survey data from YouGov, and explore how subscription trends have changed over time.

## Requirements:
The survey asks Britons:
“Do you have any of the following types of subscriptions? Please tick all that apply.”

Our data fields are:

1. **Survey Date:** The dates when the survey was conducted (2019 - 2024).
2. **Subscription Type:** The category of the subscription. (e.g. Music, Film, Magazine)
3. **Percentage:** The percentage of respondents, either within a specific age group or across all adults, who reported having a particular subscription type.
4. **Base:** The total number of respondents included after weighting for demographic balance.
5. **Unweighted Base:** The raw number of respondents before any adjustments.
