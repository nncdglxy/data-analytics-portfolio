# Build a Bar Chart | #B2VB 2025 | Week 1

## Goal
Visualize New Yearâ€™s resolutions data provided by AP NORC using Bar Charts. 
The data looks at the percentage of adults who plan to make at least one resolution, focusing on areas like health, finances, and personal habits.
Data fields are:
- Resolution Category: The focus area of the resolution (e.g., eating healthier, exercise).
- Percentage: The percentage of adults planning to make a resolution in each category.
